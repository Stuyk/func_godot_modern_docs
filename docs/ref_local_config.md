# Project Settings

FuncGodot adds a few helpful Project Settings to Godot.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Property | Type | Description |
| Default Map Settings | [FuncGodotMapSettings](ref_func_godot_map.html#MapSettings) | Map settings resource a new [FuncGodotMap](ref_func_godot_map.md) will attempt to use by default when added to the SceneTree. |
| Model Point Class Save Path | String | Relative directory path from your Map Editor Game Path to a subfolder where GLB files generated by [FuncGodotFGDModelPointClass](ref_fgd_resources.html#ModelPoint) will be saved. |
| Default Inverse Scale Factor | Float | [Scale factor](guide_building_maps.html#InverseScaleFactor) that affects how [FuncGodot FGD Model Point Class](ref_fgd_resources.html#ModelPoint) entities scale their map editor display models. Not used with TrenchBroom, use [TrenchBroom Game Config](ref_trenchbroom_resources.html#GameConfig)  <br>'s _Entity Scale_ expression instead. |

# FuncGodotLocalConfig

Local machine project wide settings. Can define global defaults for some FuncGodot properties.

### DO NOT CREATE A NEW RESOURCE!

This resource works by saving a _MyGameFuncGodotConfig.json_ configuration file to your game's [**_user://_**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#accessing-persistent-user-data-user) folder and pulling the properties from that config file rather than this resource. Use the premade _addons/func\_godot/func\_godot\_local\_config.tres_ instead.

> _NOTE: You need to run your project at least once before attempting to export settings, so that the_ user:// _folder can be created by Godot! Otherwise you will run into an error and the config file will not export!_

Handling local project configuration settings in this way means they need to be set individually on every machine you load your project onto. These settings are _not_ saved to source control. The benefit is that this allows teams to more easily work together even with drastically different tool installation paths.

| Property | Type | Description |
| Export Func Godot Settings | Bool | Button to save the local machine project configuration settings in your game's _user://_ folder. |
| Reload Func Godot Settings | Bool | Button to reload the local machine project configuration settings in your game's _user://_ folder. This can be used in case you need to revert changes to the Local Config resource, so long as you have not export your changes already. |

| Trenchbroom Game Config Folder | String, Global Directory | Global directory path where your TrenchBroom game configuration should be saved to. Consult the [TrenchBroom Manual's Game Configuration documentation](https://trenchbroom.github.io/manual/latest/#game_configuration_files) for more information. |
| Netradiant Custom Gamepacks Folder | String, Global Directory | Global directory path where your NetRadiant Custom gamepacks are saved. On Windows this is the _gamepacks_ folder in your NetRadiant Custom installation. |
